SMART

S - 	Specific. Define the goal as much as possible with no unclear language. Who, What, Where, Why, and When.

M -	Measurable. Can you track your progress and measure the outcome. How much, how many, how will I know when my goal is complete.

A - 	Attainable. Is the goal reasonable enough to be accomplished, how so. Make sure the goal is not out of reach or below standard performance.
 
R - 	Relevant. Is the goal worthwhile and will it meet your needs. Is each goal consistant with the other goals you have established and fits with your immediate and long term plans.

T - 	Timely. Your objective should includes time limit. It will establish a sense of urgency and prompt you to have better time management.



Common Mistakes:
	- Focusing on too few areas
	- Setting unrealistic goals
	- Setting too many goals
	- Setting "other people's" goals
	- Not appreciating failure.
