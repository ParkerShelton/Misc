Overall notes:  Due July 13th
  - only need html right now. (im going to do css because ugly websites hurt my head)

Home:
  - links at the top
  - have my initals as like a hero sorta
  - id like to have the site as minimal and content driven as possible
  - if i have time, make the links be hidden and have them slide in from a menu button
  - if it were up to me id have the home page not scroll, have it all fit on one screen
  - have three divs to describe the main purpose of the site
  - I think itd be cool to have my participation in the r2h written as if it were source code or something


Biography: 
  - Have the page split into 3 divs top left, bottom left, and the right column is one div
  - Title in the top left
  - Picture in the bottom left
  - whole right column is a description about me
