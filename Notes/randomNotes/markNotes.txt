CSS positioning


	- static (the default)
	- absolute (takes the element out of the flow, its pinned to the body not the window) 
	- relative (preserves the elements original position in the flow)
	- fixed (does come out of the flow, its pinned to the window not the body)



uses  for relative: 
	- acts as parent for absolutely positioned elements
	- can be used to slightly shift an element while keeping its position in the flow
