Part 3 Chapter 3 - How to Win Friends, take-aways:




	- Being honest, even when you are wrong, shows a lot of humility.
	- Even if you feel like what you were doing isnt 'wrong' being honest is still the best way to go.

	- Its much easier to admit you are wrong than hearing it from someone else

	- The book says that if you admit you are wrong before someone else does, their attitude will be better towards you. I disagree. He might have just had a lucky life but I havent so he can only speak for himself.
