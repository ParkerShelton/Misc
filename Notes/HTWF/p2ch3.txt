How To Win Friends: Part 2 Chapter 3 Takeaways.



	- People can be (most of the time are) very self-centered. Even if you are talking to some one about personal gain, mentioning them as much as possible can get you far.


	- People also notice and like the small things. Remembering their family members or pets or small details is very easy to do, but people take notice to those things. Something as small as pronouncing someones name correctly can have a drastic effect on their mood.


	- Making people feel important is one of the best ways to get what you want. I never really thought about how just having your name remembered can change your day. It's something so small you dont think about it but once I read this chapter, I could see how important it really is.


	- Remembering names and details can help you if youre a polititan, but it can also help you succeed in any profession. People need to feel important so the more you make them feel like they are, the greater chance you have of them supporting you.
