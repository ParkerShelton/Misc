Part 3 Chapter 4, How to Win Friends: take-aways


	- Treat people how you want to be treated. Most of the time, if you are mean to someone, theyll be mean back. If you are nice to someone, theyll likely be nice back.

	- Everyine is taught that when they are young but for some reason, people will still be mean to you and expect you to be nice back.

	- if someone is being rude to you, if you are nice to them anyway, their mood might change. Everyone has a bad day so if you try and be nice to everyone, people will notice.

	- Even when you know you are right about something, you dont have to agree with someone but you shouldnt try and prove why they are wrong. Stand up for yourself but at the same time dont be arrogant and rude about it.
