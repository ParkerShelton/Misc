Part 2 chapter 4, HTWF



	- To be a good conversationalist, you don't even have to be good at talking.

	- A lot of times, being a good listener is more important than speaking well. Being generally interested in what the other person is saying and listening will make them feel good and keep talking and naturally like you, even if you daont say anything at all.


	- "Exclusive attention to the personwho is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that." - Charles W Eliot.
