Part 3 Chapter 2 Take-aways



	- You can tell someone they are wrong with words, but also by facial expressions, gestures, posture, your tone. There are a lot of ways of telling someone they are wrong.

	- If you sit there and try to explain why someone is wrong, neither of you will get anything good out of it. Instead of explaining why they are wrong, you should explain why you are right. If you have ligitement facts why you are right, they might actually agree with you, but no matter how right you are, if you tell someone they are wrong, theyll disagree with you no matter how right you are.


	- Even then, you still dont want to come out and tell someone you are going to prove you are right. If you want to prove something to someone, do it subtly as to let them think about it themselves instead of feeling forced to change their belief.

	- you wil never get into trouble admitting you may be wrong. It makes who you are talking to feel more understood and less angry with you. Letting them know that you arent perfect and you dont act like you are, makes you seem more human and understanding.
