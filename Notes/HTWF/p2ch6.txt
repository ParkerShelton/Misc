How to Win Friends: Part 2 Chapter 5.


	- I've said before that people are selfish, I just get that same message in this chapter. Most people wont do anything for someone else, unless they get something in return.

	- Something as simple as a little compliment can make someones day. You wont get anything in return except that you know you made omeone else happy.

	- That is something I've been working a lot on recently. Before Road to Hire, I was really selfish. I wouldnt do anything unless I could squeeze something out of them to use. I was manipulative and in a very bad spot. Since Road to Hire, I've been really trying to help others without asking for anything in return.
