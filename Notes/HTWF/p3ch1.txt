Part 3 Chapter 1 take aways



	- The best way to win an argument is to not hsve one.

	- "A man convinced against his will, Is of the same opinion still."

	- If you dont have something nice to say, dont say it at all. Weve all heard that saying, the chapter relates it to business and selling but it can be applied anywhere.

	- "Hatred is never ended by hatred, but by love" This chapter has some really good quotes.
