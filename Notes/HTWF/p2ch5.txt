Part 2 Chapter 5:


	- People love hearing about themselves. If you start by talking about what you have in common, they will be more likely to listen and enjoy what you say.

	- Talking about how you are different, it might come across as you think youre better than them and theyll likely shut down.

	- When you start by saying your differences, it might seem like you are saying you are right, and they are wrong. 

 	- Even though youd be talking about them when you say your differences, it can easily seem negative and thats the opposite of what you want.
