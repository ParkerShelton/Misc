Rules for responsive web design:

	- rule 1: viewport meta
	- rule 2: use fluid units (percentages)
	- rule 3: flexbox is awesome
	- rule 4: CONTENT first, not mobile


if you use media quiries min and max-width to edit an element use -1px to avoid double breakpoints

use $variable to set a breakpoint variable
@media (min-width $variable)




look up viewport meta tag

-- Dont forget to use height, not just width.



for simulator open xcode, open developer tool, simulator




flex basic
flex grow
order!	use as needed, be careful

#################### BASICALLY LEARN FLEXBOX ####################


dont forget box-sizing and border-bo





css scroll snapping to make sliders	(only supported in safari and ios currently)
